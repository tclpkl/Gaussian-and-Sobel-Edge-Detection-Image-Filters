I learned and implemented kernel image processing and convulution techniques to code 3 image filters. I also applied the Gaussian equation and Sobel Operator to create blurring, sharpening, and edge detection functions (Gaussian Blur and Sobel Edge Detection Filter).

Relevant links to implemented concepts/algorithms:
