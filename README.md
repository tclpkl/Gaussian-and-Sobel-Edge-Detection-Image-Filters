# Gaussian And Sobel Edge Detection Image Filters
Developed by Timothy Lin

## About
I implemented kernel image processing and convulution techniques to code 3 image filters. I also applied the Gaussian equation and Sobel Operator to create blurring, sharpening, and edge detection functions (Gaussian Blur and Sobel Edge Detection Filter). These were used to help familiarize myself with the basics of these concepts and also later aided in the image processing techniques used in the FAF image analysis project.
